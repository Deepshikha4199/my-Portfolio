<p>I love this tv series. I have watched this almost 4 to 5 times, all the characters are best but joey is my love. Give this a try, it's worth to watch it.</p>

<p>The reason why The Vampire Diaries kept people hooked was because of its unique storylines and shocking plot twists. Stefan's Ripper side, Prison Worlds, the cure to Vampirism, and the Originals represent the best of the show's writing.</p>

<p>Stranger things</p>

<p>The show is known for its likeable cast of characters, plot, nostalgic tones, and mix of the horror, drama, science-fiction, mystery, and coming-of-age genres.</p>
